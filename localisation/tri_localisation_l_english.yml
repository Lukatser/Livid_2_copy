 china3t: "Journey to the West Printed"
 china4t: "Jin Ping Mei Printed"
 china5t: "Rulin Waishi Printed"
 china6t: "Dream of the Red Chamber Printed"
 china1d: "The most widely read, and often considered to be the single greatest, of all the novels in imperial and modern China, Romance of the Three Kingdoms chronicles, mystifies, and romanticizes one of the most turbulent periods in the history of China. Its tales of battles, and of the rise and fall of dynasties vying for control of China, have always managed to inspire the populace to contribute to the great events in history however they can. \nIn this time of war, many are drawing parallels between the past and the present. Some even feel encouraged to repeat the heroism of the past, and we may very well need it to fight against the enemies from without."
 china2d: "For those who hold to the belief that the Emperor of China receives his power and legitimacy as a reward from the heavens, rebellion is seen as not just a nuisance to be crushed, but also as the Emperor's punishment for his failures. It would make logical sense, then, that granting amnesty to rebels would not be a sign of weakness, but rather as a strengthening of legitimacy - as long as those rebels fulfille a purpose, as they do in Water Margin.\nThis point has become quite relevant in our own time, as bands of outlaws plunder the land that the Emperor is meant to protect. If we could a way for them to serve us, we could accept some of their demands and spin a story of imperial capitulation into a tale of redemption through servitude, which is a story that any country aiming to achieve internal stability and prosperity should promulgate."
 china3d: "What is west of the deserts and mountains on our frontier? Monkeys? Demons? More? During the Golden Age of China under the Tang, those regions were controlled, albeit loosely, and much about them was known; however, the chaos of the centuries past has severely restricted our grasp over those territories. We do, however, have a number of written records available to us.\nIt was based on one of those records, that of a monk from the Tang era, that a poet and writer has recently written a book, with tales of an enlightened monkey, an admiral pig, and much more. His work has quickly spread, and has aroused newfound interest in exploring the lands once held by the Tang and bringing them back under our control, as they should rightfully be. We could use this popular interest to organize an expedition to the west, and see what we can make of the situation there."
 china4d: "What started off as a spin-off of the Water Margin, Jin Ping Mei went on to be one of the first novels to utilize modern techniques, and reached great popularity due to its excellent recreation of the social world of early modern China. However, some aspects of the novel, particularly its explicit explorations of human sexuality, were highly controversial and gained it much notoriety. Despite this, many praised it for its moral teachings or its style, and it went on to be considered one of the greatest Chinese novels ever written."
 china5d: "To criticize the current dynasty is to risk death; to criticize their predecessors is far more acceptable. As it happens, there is much to criticize now. The current rulers of China are letting the bureaucratic system rot as the Ming did before them, lowering the Imperial standards.\nAs a result of this degredation, a recently-printed book that heavily criticizes the Ming has gained much popularity among the middle classes, and even though it does not criticize us directly, it would be wise to act now, before the whispers come spreading. The Imperial Examination System, the Imperial bureaucracy, and even some parts of the court must be reformed to conform to the Enlightened ideals that have recently taken hold within our society."
 china6d: "The situation is looking grim. The war has been getting more and more expensive every day, taking its toll on the economy and especially on the population. Some are even starting to whisper that it is not the will of the heavens for our state to win.\nBut it was in these dire times that one of our citizens has published a literary work worthy of being called a great classic. It is a tale of two lovers from feuding noble families, and this family feud goes on to catch the attention of the Emperor himself, who does not hesitate to act quickly and decisively to put an end to the internal quarrel. Though we are not at war with ourselves, there is still a precedent set here for the actions that a state can take, and we could greatly improve the war progress if we spread this work to renew the public confidence in the state."

Once a major world religion, Manichaeism is now limited to only a few families in Fujian, and will likely disappear within the next few dynastic years. Some in the imperial court argue that unity of faith leads to unity of rule, and that eliminating this sect will only strengthen our mandate.

 porcupine.1.t: "Golden Age of Porcupines"
 porcupine.1.d: "As our hardy seamen returned from the New World, they brought captured local wildlife with them. Some, like exotic birds, were fawned over in the courts; others got so little attention that they were set free. \nAmong the latter were a prickle of porcupines, who in the absence of natural predators managed to spread rapidly throughout the world, wreaking havoc in their wake. They chewed leaves off of trees, harming their growth and the timber industry, leaving no ship's mast beyond gnawing. They also absolutely terrorized any salt mines and saltpans that did not have an active garrison."
 porcupine.1.a: "No doubt they'll find the salt mines."
 porcupine.2.t: "Shipbuilding Forests Damaged by Porcupines"
 porcupine.2.d: "As porcupines spread throughout the forests where they had never been seen before, they proceeded to damage trees seemingly at random. The lower quality of the wood would impact not just global markets for good wood, but shipbuilding as well."
 porcupine.2.a: "Navies of the world will suffer."
 porcupine.3.t: "Pirates Challenge Weakened Navies"
 porcupine.3.d: "As the shipbuilding crisis weakened navies worldwide, some entrepreneurs decided to make a living by preying on less protected shipping lanes, leading to issues with the import of plantation goods from overseas colonies."
 porcupine.3.a: "Soon, piracy may have a golden age."
 porcupine.4.t: "The Salt Crisis"
 porcupine.4.d: "No doubt as a consequence of their salt-seeking habits, porcupines have more and more frequently been sighted inside salt mines... it is likely not a coincidence that the supply of salt has become unusually low, and salt itself has become more expensive."
 porcupine.4.a: "Keep the porcupines away from the salt mines!"
 porcupine.5.t: "The Iron Quill Tercios"
 porcupine.5.d: "The pike-and-shot square has been a staple of the battlefield for a few decades by now; however, the hardiness of porcupines has led various military groups to experiment with the implementation of this idea. The innovations were particularly useful against cavalry charges across the globe."
 porcupine.5.a: "What military development will porcupines inspire next?"
 porcupine.6.t: "The Porcupine Situation Has Ended!"
 porcupine.6.d: "At last, the porcupine situation has been brought under control. The forests are rejuvenating and the salt mines are back in business. The recent spike in piracy may take a few more years to fix, but there are reasons to be hopeful."
 porcupine.6.a: "I'm livid."
 porcupine.11.t: "North American Porcupine"
 porcupine.11.desc: "Porcupines have a habit of seeking out and consuming objects containing salt - sweaty clothes, smelly gum shoes, certain kinds of paint and impregnated wood. They are also attracted to roads sprinkled with salt, and will lick salt from asphalt and cars' tires - a habit that has caused severe health problems."
 porcupine.11.a: "Open the salt mines to feed the porcupines!"
 porcupine.11.b: "Defending salt mines from the porcupines begins by expanding the local administration."
 porcupine.11.c: "Before dealing with other threats, we must fortify the salt mines against porcupines."
